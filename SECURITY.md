# 🔒 Security Policy - Biz Stratosphere

## Overview

Biz Stratosphere implements enterprise-grade security with end-to-end encryption, zero-knowledge architecture, and comprehensive security controls to protect your sensitive business data.

---

## 🛡️ Security Features

### End-to-End Encryption

**All sensitive data is encrypted before leaving your browser:**

- **Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 with SHA-256 (100,000 iterations)
- **Key Size:** 256-bit encryption keys
- **IV:** Unique random initialization vector for each encryption
- **Authentication:** 128-bit authentication tag prevents tampering

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

**We cannot read your data:**

- Encryption/decryption happens entirely in your browser
- Master keys are derived from your password and never stored
- Server only stores encrypted blobs
- Recovery requires your password or recovery key
- **Lost password = lost data** (by design for maximum security)

### Data Protection

**What's encrypted:**

- ✅ All uploaded datasets (CSV, Excel files)
- ✅ Generated reports and visualizations
- ✅ User-created charts and configurations
- ✅ API keys and secrets
- ✅ Sensitive user profile information
- ✅ Workspace data and collaboration content

**What's NOT encrypted:**

- ❌ Public metadata (file names, creation dates)
- ❌ System logs (anonymized)
- ❌ Usage statistics (aggregated)

## 🔐 Authentication & Access Control

### Password Security

**Requirements:**

- Minimum 12 characters
- Must include uppercase and lowercase letters
- Must include numbers
- Must include special characters
- Checked against 600M+ breached passwords (Have I Been Pwned)
- Strength scored using zxcvbn algorithm

**Storage:**

- Passwords hashed with Bcrypt (10+ rounds)
- Salted uniquely per user
- Never stored in plaintext
- Never transmitted in logs

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Supported methods:**

- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) via authenticator apps
- SMS backup codes (optional)
- 10 one-time recovery codes

**Enforcement:**

- Optional for regular users
- Mandatory for admin accounts
- Mandatory for API key generation

### Session Security

**Protection measures:**

- 30-minute session timeout (configurable)
- Secure session token rotation
- Device fingerprinting for anomaly detection
- Automatic logout on inactivity
- Concurrent session limits
- Session revocation on password change

---

## 🚀 Transport Security

### HTTPS/TLS

**Encryption in transit:**

- TLS 1.3 enforced (minimum TLS 1.2)
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- HSTS enabled (max-age: 1 year)
- Certificate pinning for critical connections
- Automatic upgrade of insecure requests

### Security Headers

**Implemented headers:**

```
Content-Security-Policy (CSP)     - Prevents XSS attacks
Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)  - Forces HTTPS
X-Frame-Options: DENY             - Prevents clickjacking
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff   - Prevents MIME sniffing
X-XSS-Protection                  - Browser XSS protection
Referrer-Policy                   - Controls referrer information
Permissions-Policy                - Restricts browser features
```

---

## 🔑 Key Management

### Key Hierarchy

```
User Password
    └─> Master Key (PBKDF2-derived, never stored)
         └─> Data Encryption Key (DEK)
              └─> Encrypts: Datasets, Reports, Files

Recovery Key (optional)
    └─> Can decrypt DEK for account recovery
```

### Key Storage

- **Master Key:** Never stored, derived from password on-demand
- **DEK:** Encrypted with Master Key, stored in database
- **Session Keys:** Stored in memory, wiped on logout
- **Recovery Key:** User-controlled, stored offline

### Key Rotation

**When keys are rotated:**

- Password change → New Master Key, re-encrypt DEK
- Security incident → Force re-encryption of all data
- Annual rotation → Recommended best practice

**How rotation works:**

1. Decrypt DEK with old Master Key
2. Generate new Master Key from new password
3. Re-encrypt DEK with new Master Key
4. Update stored encrypted DEK
5. Wipe old keys from memory

## 📊 Audit Logging

### What We Log

**Security events:**

- Login attempts (success/failure)
- Password changes
- MFA setup/removal
- API key generation/revocation
- Data access (who, what, when)
- Permission changes
- Export events
- Account lockouts
- Suspicious activity

**Logs are:**

- Encrypted at rest
- Immutable (append-only)
- Retained for 90 days (configurable)
- Available for SIEM integration

### Intrusion Detection

**Monitored patterns:**

- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Geographic anomalies
- Rapid API calls (rate limiting)
- Brute force attempts
- Session hijacking indicators

**Auto-responses:**

- Account lockout (5 failed attempts)
- CAPTCHA challenges
- Admin notifications
- Temporary IP blocks
- Session termination

---

## 🌐 API Security

### Authentication

**API key requirements:**

- 256-bit random generation
- Bcrypt hashed in database
- Scoped permissions (read/write)
- Expiration dates
- Rate limiting per key

### Rate Limiting

**Default limits:**

- 100 requests per minute (authenticated)
- 20 requests per minute (unauthenticated)
- 1000 requests per hour (burst)

**Exceeded limits result in:**

- HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Retry-After header
- Exponential backoff required

### Request Encryption

**For sensitive endpoints:**

- Request payloads encrypted
- Ephemeral per-request keys
- Response payload encryption
- Prevents packet sniffing
